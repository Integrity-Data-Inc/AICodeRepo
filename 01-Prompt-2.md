Create a `Models` project with domain models for payroll:

- PayrollDocument
- Employee
- PayCode, Earning, Deduction, Benefit, Tax
- ValidationResult

Use C# records where appropriate. All models should be serializable with `System.Text.Json`.
Follow PascalCase naming and group related models into folders.
